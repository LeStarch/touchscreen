# WaveSource 7 Inch 1024x600 ThouchScreen Driver

This is a driver for the WaveSource 7 Inch 1024x600 touchscreen designed for use with the Rasberry Pi.  This driver should work with any linux distribution supporting: hidraw,udev, and uinput.

**Note:** Due to less than acceptable performance of the touchscreen (as a physical device), work on this driver has been discontinued.  This software *should* work, but may not be complete. It also does not support more than single touch.
